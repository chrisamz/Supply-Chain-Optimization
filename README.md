# Supply Chain Optimization

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a model to optimize inventory levels, reduce lead times, and improve the efficiency of the supply chain. By effectively managing inventory and optimizing supply chain processes, businesses can reduce costs, increase customer satisfaction, and enhance overall operational efficiency. The project demonstrates skills in linear programming, optimization algorithms, predictive modeling, and operations research.

## Components

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Collect and preprocess data related to inventory levels, lead times, demand forecasts, and supply chain processes. Ensure the data is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.

- **Data Sources:** Inventory records, supplier data, historical demand data, lead time records.
- **Techniques Used:** Data cleaning, normalization, handling missing values, feature engineering.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Perform EDA to understand the data distribution, identify patterns, and gain insights into the factors affecting supply chain efficiency.

- **Techniques Used:** Data visualization, summary statistics, correlation analysis.

### 3. Predictive Modeling
Develop predictive models to forecast future demand and lead times, which are critical inputs for optimization.

- **Techniques Used:** Time series analysis, regression models, machine learning algorithms.

### 4. Optimization Modeling
Create optimization models to determine optimal inventory levels, reorder points, and supply chain strategies.

- **Techniques Used:** Linear programming, mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), optimization algorithms.

### 5. Operations Research
Apply operations research techniques to analyze and improve supply chain processes, such as supplier selection, transportation planning, and inventory management.

- **Techniques Used:** Network modeling, simulation, queuing theory.
